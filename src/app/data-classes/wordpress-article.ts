Substance abuse and chronic relapses have many root causes, and could potentially be moderated with <a href=\"https://sailcannabis.co/research/12/337\">transdermal</a> CBD.</p>\n<h3>Transdermal CBD As An Avenue To Quell Drug Relapses</h3>\n<p>In the study rats with as self-administered cocaine and alcohol addiction were treated with transdermal CBD for seven days, in 24-hour intervals. These rats were placed under various levels of stress and anxiety, and monitored accordingly.</p>\n<p>The results, transdermal CBD was effective in reducing context-induced, and stress-induced drug seeking behviour in these rats. Additionally, the reduction in drug-seeking behaviour came without any impairment through the use of CBD, along with the the lack of development of any kind of tolerance and any changes normal day-to-day behaviour. Furthermore, five months after CBD treatment had been stopped, these animals still experienced reduced stress-induced relapses. Even more interestingly, while relapses were reduced five months after treatment, CBD only remained detectable within the animals for three days.</p>\n<h3>Research Surrounding CBDâ€™s Therapeutic Potentials Continues to Grow</h3>\n<p>As a result, researchers are confident that this study provides proof of principle, supporting the potentials of CBD in relation to drug relapses, offer benefits to addicts when in a vulnerable state, with lasting effects despite having only a short exposure to treatment. This piece of research contributes to the overall research base surrounding the therapeutic benefits of CBD, and furthering the discussion on CBD as a viable treatment method for a long list of conditions.</p>\n<p><u>Work Cited</u></p>\n<p>Gonzalez-Cuevas G, Martin-Fardon R, Kerr TM, et al.
